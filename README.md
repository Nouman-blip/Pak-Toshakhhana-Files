# Exploring "Pak Tosha Khana Files" Dataset

Hello LinkedIn community!

I recently stumbled upon an incredible dataset on Kaggle called "Pak Tosha Khana Files," and as a data analysis enthusiast, I couldn't resist the opportunity to dive into it. However, the dataset was quite messy, so I took it upon myself to clean it up using SQL. After removing useless rows, updating null values in retention costs to 0, and categorizing unknown items, I was ready to explore the data and formulate some interesting questions.

You can find the cleaned data and SQL code on my [Github page](https://lnkd.in/dStDJiKU).

The resulting analysis covers the years 2002 to 2022 and is available on my [Github page](https://lnkd.in/dK8Gs_8g). Here are some of the most intriguing findings:

1. The total assessed value of gifts from foreign leaders and former government officials was 1,177,771,620.
